# jQuery to React Migration

This project is an example of migrating a simple form app from jQuery to React. The original app was built using jQuery and JavaScript, and it has been migrated to React for improved maintainability and code organization.

## Technologies Used

- React
- HTML
- CSS

## Migration Steps

1. Created a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Analyzed the existing jQuery code and identified the key functionality.
3. Created React components to mirror the structure and functionality of the original jQuery code.
4. Migrated the event handling logic from jQuery to React using React's state and event handling features.
5. Replaced jQuery DOM manipulation with React's JSX syntax and virtual DOM.
6. Updated the CSS styles to match the original design.
7. Tested the migrated app to ensure it works correctly in the React environment.

## How to Run the Migrated App

To run the migrated app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-migration.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-migration`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Directory Structure

- The `public/` directory contains the static HTML file.
- The `src/` directory contains the React components and CSS styles.
- The `README.md` file provides information about the project and its migration process.

## Conclusion

By migrating the form app from jQuery to React, we have improved code maintainability, modularity, and the overall development experience. React's component-based architecture and declarative nature allow for easier development and future enhancements. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own jQuery to React migration projects.
